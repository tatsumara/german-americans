           <h1>John Steinbeck</h1>
           <img src="../images/john-steinbeck.jpg">
            <p>John Ernst Steinbeck was born on 27/2/1902 in Salinas, California. He was an US-American author with German-Irish ancestry. His family came from <span class="accent">Heiligenhaus</span> near DÃ¼sseldorf. His grandfather moved to Florida because he fell in love with an American woman on one of his trips and got married. The Steinbecks have lived in America ever since.</p>
			<p>John Steinbeck had a huge influence on <span class="accent">American literature</span> through such works as The Grapes of Wrath, which won him many prizes, such as the Nobel Prize in Literature or the Pulitzer Prize. His works were honored with many different film adaptations.</p>
			<p>1944 Steinbeck was a <span class="accent">war reporter</span> during the Second World War on the side of the Allies. What was special about his works was that Steinbeck wrote about simple workers and people on the edge of society, but also about topics such as the experience of the Great Depression.</p>
			<p>Accordingly, his works had a realistic style and the people, from whose point of view he wrote, were always presented with empathy and sympathy. His commitment was also shown in his most famous work, <span class="accent">The Grapes Of Wrath</span>. The book deals with the journey and experiences of a family, as happened to thousands of others who worked as farmers in the West and were chased away from their farms and hoped for a better life in California, but were treated as unwanted and bad people. This book is an example of the message of Steinbeck. He was embedded in the lives of the poor people and raised <span class="accent">awareness</span> and <span class="accent">visibility</span> for their circumstances.</p>

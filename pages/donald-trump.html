		   <p>Donald Trump is one of the best-known people in the world. He was the <span style="color: var(--accent)";>46th President</span> of the United States of America and before that one of the richest businesspeople of the US.</p>
		   <p>Before his presidential time he did not have any governmental or military background. It was the first time that a man like him got into such a high position.</p>
		   <p>But not many know about his origin. He has German relatives and with that German lineage. His grandfather left Germany (<span style="color: var(--accent)";>Bobenheim am Berg</span>, a village in the Palatinate) in 1885 and his father was born in N.Y. Mr. Trump is, in other words, the second generation of the American Trump family, and his forebears are immigrants. The questionable thing is, “Why is he so against immigrants when his forebears were immigrants themselves?”</p>

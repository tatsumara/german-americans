        	<p>Marlene Dietrich, who was a German-American actress and singer, was born in Berlin on 27th December 1901 and died in Paris on 6th May 1992.</p>
			<p>She was the Hollywood and style icon of the 20th century. Her signature traits were her long legs, her deep smoky-erotic voice and her <span class="accent">iconic overalls</span>.</p>
			<p>Marlene began her career with theater and silent movies in Berlin. After that she got the leading role in the movie <span class="accent">"The blue Angel"</span> in 1930, which won her international fame.</p>
			<p>With the beginning of the 1950s, she started to work as a <span class="accent">singer</span>. Her most famous international known songs are: "Ich bin von Kopf bis Fu√ü auf Liebe eingestellt", "Lilli Marleen", "Ich hab noch einen Koffer in Berlin" and "Sag mir, wo die Blumen sind".</p>
			<p>In the 1970s, she retired from the show business and lived in a small apartment in <span class="accent">Paris</span> until her death. During the time of the Nazis, she <span class="accent">refused to support the Nazis</span> and became a U.S. citizen in 1939.

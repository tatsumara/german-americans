			<p>There she became an American citizen and renounced her German citizenship. She was not happy with the government and its actions. Until 1960, she <span class="accent">helped refugees</span> and performed for American soldiers. After that, she moved back to Germany. Because she did not feel welcome there anymore, she moved back to Paris. On 6th May 1992 she died there.</p>

		   <p>You might have heard of him or not but if you didn't, you missed out big time. On September 12th 1957 little Hans Zimmer breathes his first breath and gives <span style="color: var(--accent)";>Frankfurt am Main</span> the honor to be the birthplace of one of the most important composers of the 20th and 21st century. Proudly we can say that he is of German ancestry. His mother Brigitte Zimmer and Hans J. Zimmer both are German citizens.</p>
		   <p>Hans Zimmer has always been a little music and piano genius. People like that are surely born this talented. He stayed in England to get his A level certificate at the boarding school “Hurtwood House”. This is also where he had his breakthrough as the dazzling composer he now is. The soundtrack of <span style="color: var(--accent)";>"Rain Man"</span>, released in 1988, which he took credit for, was one thing that was the start to his continuous success.</p>
		   <p>After that, he was mostly active in Hollywood, composing music for great movies like “The Lion King” (1994), “Crimson Tide” (1995) or “Gladiator” (2000). However, he is best-known for his music released in the 21st century. Now he's associated with stunning movies like “Pirates of the Caribbean” (2007), “Interstellar” (2014) and my personal favorite <span style="color: var(--accent)";>"Dune" (2021)</span>, which is a new high to the Hans Zimmer era.</p>

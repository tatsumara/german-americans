			<p>Johann August Röbling, a German-American engineer, was born in Mühlhausen, Thuringia, in 1806. After attending a training institute in Erfurt, he moved to Berlin to study structural engineering. Roebling stayed in the Sauerland until 1928. In <span class="accent">August 1831</span>, Roebling emigrated to America.</p>
			<p>Together with friends and acquaintances from Mühlhausen he founded the community <span class="accent">Germania (today Sachsenburg)</span> in Pennsylvania. When he received his naturalization certificate in 1837, Johann August changed his name to John A. Roebling.</p>
			<p>In 1844 he began building the first bridges such as the <span class="accent">Smithfield Street Bridge</span> in Pittsburgh and the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge over the Niagara River. Its largest and most famous structure, however, was the <span class="accent">Brooklyn Bridge</span> in New York. In 1865 Roebling began his planning, which was interrupted by an accident while surveying construction work. As a result, he died on July 22, 1869 of complications from a tetanus infection.</p>

			<p>His son Washington and his wife then took care of the completion of the bridge. For his 200th birthday, a special postage stamp was issued in his honor in Germany.</p>

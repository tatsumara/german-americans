		   <p>Hannah Arendt was a Jewish German-American political theorist and publicist. She worked as a journalist and published several articles on political philosophy.</p>
		   <p>She experienced politics as something to be afraid of, because she experienced wars as well as revolutions. Therefore, her skeptical way of thinking and her activities were related to the concept of freedom.</p>
